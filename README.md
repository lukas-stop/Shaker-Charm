# Shaker Charm Widget

Are you someone who enjoys acrylic charms?  Have you always loved acrylic shaker charms but aren't sure what the final product might look like?  Look no further!  

This widget will allow you to add as many images into a shaker charm and see how everything will bounce around!  This is perfect for people who may want to test designs or make adjustments without needing to spend the extra money to get sample charms.

# Usage

(This section will be updated as this widget's development progresses)

# Credits

This project is 100% free to be used in other projects, websites, or applications.  All I ask is that I be properly credited by linking directly back to this github repo.

Sample credit (feel free to copy this):

```
<a href=https://github.com/lukas-stop/Shaker-Charm>Shaker charm widget originally made by GooseCaboose737</a>

```

This *must* be displayed somewhere on your site or application, preferably near the shaker charm widget's placement.
